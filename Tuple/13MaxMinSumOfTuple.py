##Write functions that take a tuple and return the minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements. Print the results for a sample tuple.
def max_tuple(tple):
    return max(tple)
def min_tuple(tple):
    return min(tple)
def sum_tuple(tple):
    return sum(tple)

tple = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12)
print("Maximum element in tuple is: ",max(tple))
print("Minimum element in tuple is: ",min(tple))
print("Sum of Tuple is: ",sum(tple))
