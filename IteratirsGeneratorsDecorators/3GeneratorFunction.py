##Write a generator function named `fibonacci` that yields the Fibonacci sequence. 
#Test the generator by iterating over it and printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
def fibonacci(n):
    a,b=0,1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a,b = b,a+b
for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)
